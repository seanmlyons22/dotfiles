# Dotfiles

This repo contains the dotfiles I use on my personal computer.

The repo is intended to be cloned in the home folder, but can be placed elsewhere.

Files in this repo are symlinked to the dotfiles in the home folder using
GNU Stow as described in [this article](https://apiumhub.com/tech-blog-barcelona/managing-dotfiles-with-stow/)
